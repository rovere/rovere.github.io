    I currently work for <a href="https://cern.ch"><strong>CERN</strong></a>.
    As part of its <a href="https://home.cern/resources/faqs/high-luminosity-lhc">
      <strong>HL-LHC</strong></a> upgrade program, the <a href="https://home.cern/fr/science/cms">
      <strong>CMS</strong></a> collaboration is designing a High Granularity
    Calorimeter (HGCAL) to replace the existing endcap calorimeters. As HGCAL
    DPG Convener I'm following up most of the software activities related to
    calibration and full event reconstruction with a "particle flow"-like
    approach. In particular, the reconstruction framework is designed with
    heterogeneous architectures (mainly, but not only, GPU) and parallel
    algorithms in mind.

  I obtained my "Laurea" degree in <strong>Particle Physics</strong> from the
  Insubria University in Como. I obtained the Ph.D. in <strong>Particle
  Physics</strong> from the very same University a couple of years later.

  I enjoy writing <strong>fast and efficient</strong> reconstruction algorithms for the CMS experiment.
  <a href="https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw"><strong>CMSSW</strong></a> is the
  project I contribute the most, at present.

  I enjoy also writing <strong>fast and efficient</strong> parallel and
  heterogeneous algorithms for the CMS experiment.
  Have a look at the <a href="https://github.com/cms-patatrack/cmssw"><strong>Patatrack</strong></a>
  project if you want to know more.
