After a rather long period of development and an even longer writing effort, we
can finally announce that our work on the **CLUE** clustering
algorithm for the **HGCAL** detector is available on arxViv: [link][clue-arxiv].

As soon as possible we will submit it for publication.

For more information about **CLUE** and its usage in the **HGCAL**
reconstruction, please read [here][clue-reco].
